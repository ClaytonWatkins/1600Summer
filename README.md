1600Summer

Day two I learned a lot.

Git = database
GitHub = webservice
GitKraken = Local software for file managment and interfacing?

"unstaged" = locally saved only
"staged" = preparing to build placeholders on the service with local file names

"WIP" = work in progress, meaning GitKraken see changes in the folders but does not know what they are yet
change "WIP" = Naming the work being done

Descriptions are important, give yourself a reminder what the heck you were doing. 
NO you will not remember once you have a thousand projects going.

"Commit Changes to X files" = actually building placeholders on the server

Other Notes:
Pull = retrieved files from the cloud to work on locally
Push = sends the placeholder files you commited and syncs with the cloud

Remember descriptions help you to know what you were thinking when you made the file/changes.

Git file size limit is around 10MB
Git file size we will likely deal with in class is only about 3MB
If you need to manage larger files they may have to go through Google Drive or DropBox

You can change the description and the Commit name after the fact
