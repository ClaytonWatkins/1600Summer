1600Summer

Day two I learned a lot.

Git = database
GitHub = webservice
GitKraken = Local software for file managment and interfacing?

"unstaged" = locally saved only
"staged" = preparing to build placeholders on the service with local file names
"Commit Changes to X files" = actually building placeholders on the server
