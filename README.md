1600Summer

Day two I learned a lot.

Git = database
GitHub = webservice
GitKraken = Local software for file managment and interfacing?

"unstaged" = locally saved only
"staged" = preparing to build placeholders on the service with local file names

"WIP" = work in progress, meaning GitKraken see changes in the folders but does not know what they are yet
change "WIP" = Naming the work being done

Descriptions are important, give yourself a reminder what the heck you were doing. 
NO you will not remember once you have a thousand projects going.

"Commit Changes to X files" = actually building placeholders on the server
